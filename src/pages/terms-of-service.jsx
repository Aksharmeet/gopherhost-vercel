          Hosting Account Disk Usage
        </h2>
        <p className='text-md mt-4 text-gray-600'>
          All files uploaded to any of GopherHost’s hosting accounts must be for
          the sole purpose of using those files on the customer’s website.
          GopherHost’s hosting accounts are not to be used for file storage or
          data archiving. If we determine that a customer is storing a large
          amount of files on their hosting accounts that are not for the purpose
          of being served on their website, the customer will be first warned
          and may be subject to a violation of this terms of use.

          Website Streaming
        </h2>
        <p className='text-md mt-4  text-gray-600'>
          Webservers are meant for serving files and not specifically designed
          to serve streaming media. Streaming large amounts of video and audio
          files is not recommended as it may slow down other visitors to your
          site. We recommend streaming audio and video from other services such
          as YouTube or Vimeo. GopherHost doesn’t meter each individual hosting
          account’s bandwidth and you are free to use what you need to run your
          website. But if we determine that your hosting account is causing a
          significant resource drain on our servers, we might ask you to move
          that streaming to another service. Failure to comply might constitute
          a violation of this terms of use.

          Website Content
        </h2>
        <p className='text-md mt-4  text-gray-600'>
          We do not restrict the content on your website as long as your adhere
          to Federal U.S. and Local California laws. Hosting accounts with cases
          of bullying, hate speech, harm (especially to minors) may be
          immediately terminated and turned over to the U.S. Government for
          possible prosecution. Any copyrighted material not owned by the
          GopherHost customer maybe be asked to be taken down.
